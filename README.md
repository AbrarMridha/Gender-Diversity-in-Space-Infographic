# Space For All?
### Exploring Gender Representation in spaceflight.
This project is a data-driven infographic that visualizes the gender gap in human space exploration. From a global gender breakdown to country-wise representation and trends over time, it highlights how inclusion in space hasn’t kept pace with technological advancement.
### What's Included
The infographic includes three key visual panels:
	1.	Global Gender Breakdown – A donut chart showing how only a small percentage of astronauts have been women.
	2.	Country-wise Comparison – A bar plot of the top 10 spacefaring countries, showing how representation differs between male and female astronauts.
	3.	Trends Over Time – A line chart comparing the number of satellite launches each year to the number of female astronauts sent into space.
 ### Key Insights
* Only around 12% of astronauts have been women.
* Out of 38 countries, only 12 have sent female astronauts.
* Despite more missions and satellites, gender inclusion still lags significantly.
